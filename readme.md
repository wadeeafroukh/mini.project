# Wadeeafroukh MiniProject

This is a personal web development mini-project created as part of my studies in the HackerU Web Development course.

The project is a portfolio-style site that combines the knowledge I’ve gained so far — including HTML, CSS, Git, and design via tools like Photopea — with my passion for card games. It features multiple interactive sections including project previews, contact forms, responsive layouts, and more.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox and Media Queries)
- Git & GitHub
- Photopea for mockups/design previews

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to showcase what I’ve learned and to express creativity in a way that connects both my education and hobbies.
